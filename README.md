# Viterbi POS Tagger

A simple and efficient **Python** implementation of part-of-speech (POS) tagging using the **Viterbi algorithm**—a fundamental technique from Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) known for its speed and accuracy in sequential labeling.

##  Features
- Uses the Viterbi dynamic programming algorithm to determine the most likely sequence of POS tags from given sentences.
- Lightweight and easy to understand—great for students and developers learning HMMs and sequence models.
- Clear, dependency-free Python implementation.

##  Usage
```bash
python POS_Tagger.py "Shubham is good coder."
